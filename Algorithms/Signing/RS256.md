# RSA Signature with SHA-256

an asymmetric algorithm that uses a public/private key pair. The identity provider has a private key to generate the signature. The receiver of the JWT uses a public key to validate the JWT signature. The public key used to verify and the private key used to sign the token are linked since they are generated as a pair.

### IANA

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN, responsible for coordinating unique identifiers and numbering systems that enable the internet to function. These include IP addresses, Autonomous System (AS) numbers, and protocol parameters. IANA also manages the root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS). 

### ICANN

ICANN, which stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a non-profit organization responsible for coordinating the Internet's unique identifiers. It manages the Domain Name System (DNS), IP address allocation, and protocol parameter assignments, ensuring the internet's stable and secure operation. Essentially, ICANN helps ensure that when you type a domain name into your browser, you are directed to the correct website. 

### Ephemeral Ports

Ephemeral ports are temporary network ports used by computers to establish client-server connections. They are dynamically assigned by the operating system and are used for a short duration, typically during a communication session. These ports are part of the larger range of 65535 available ports, specifically those above 1023, and are not assigned to specific services like well-known ports.

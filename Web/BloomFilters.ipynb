    "<h3>Bloom Filters</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "When memory efficiency is critical, a Bloom Filter offers an attractive solution. A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that allows for quick checks on whether an element (like a username) is part of a set. The trade-off is that it may occasionally produce false positives — indicating that a username exists when it does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Explanation of Bloom Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bloom Filter is a smart, space-efficient tool used to check if an item is part of a set. It’s especially useful when you want to avoid storing large amounts of data. The catch? It might occasionally tell you an item is in the set when it’s not (false positive), but it will never miss an item that is actually in the set (no false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bloom Filter uses a bit array and several hash functions.\n",
    "When you add an item (like a username), the filter uses the hash functions to flip certain bits in the array to 1.\n",
    "To check if an item exists, it runs the item through the same hash functions. If all the corresponding bits are 1, the item might be in the set. If any bit is 0, the item is definitely not in the set.\n",
    "Why Use Bloom Filters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: They save memory and quickly check if something is probably in the set.\n",
    "Applications: They’re great for reducing unnecessary database queries or preventing repeated checks against a web server.\n",
    "In short, Bloom Filters are a powerful tool when you need quick, memory-efficient membership testing, as long as you can handle the occasional false positive.\n",

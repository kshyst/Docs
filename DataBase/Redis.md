# Redis

Redis is an open-source, advanced key-value store and an apt solution for building high-performance, scalable web applications. Redis has three main peculiarities that set it apart:

- Redis holds its database entirely in memory, using the disk only for persistence.
- Redis has a relatively rich set of data types when compared to many key-value data stores.
- Redis can replicate data to any number of slaves.

## Starting Redis

```bash
redis-server
redis-cli
```

# HTTP VS HTTPS

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is a protocol or set of communication rules for client-server communication. When you visit a website, your browser sends a HTTP request to the web server, which responds with an HTTP response. The web server and your browser exchange data as plaintext. In short, HTTP protocol is the underlying technology that powers network communication. As the name suggests, hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a more secure version or an extension of HTTP. In HTTPS, the browser and server establish a secure, encrypted connection before transferring data.

HTTP transmits unencrypted data, which means that information sent from a browser can be intercepted and read by third parties. This wasnâ€™t an ideal process, so it was extended into HTTPS to add another layer of security to communication. HTTPS combines HTTP requests and responses with SSL and TLS technology.

HTTPS websites must obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from an independent certificate authority (CA). These websites share the certificate with the browser before exchanging data to establish trust. The SSL certificate also contains cryptographic information, so the server and web browsers can exchange encrypted or scrambled data. The process works like this:

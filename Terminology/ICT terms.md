- **Confidentially:** When we say that confidentiality is not protected, it means that someone watching the packets can read your password or credit card information when sent over HTTP. Similarly, they can access your private documents when sent via email.
- **Integrity:** Not protecting the integrity of the data, it means that an adversary can change the contents of the transferred data.
- **Authenticity:** Ensuring we are talking with the correct server, not a fake one.
- **Authentication:** You want to be sure you communicate with the right person, not someone else pretending.

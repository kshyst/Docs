# Crack Passwords

You have to crack the hashes by hashing many different inputs (such as rockyou.txt as it covers many possible passwords), potentially adding the salt if there is one and comparing it to the target hash. Once it matches, you know what the password was. Tools like Hashcat and John the Ripper are commonly used for these purposes.

## Using GPU

Modern GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have thousands of cores. They are specialised in digital image processing and accelerating computer graphics. Although they canâ€™t do the same sort of work that a CPU can, they are very good at some mathematical calculations involved in hash functions. You can use a graphics card to crack many hash types quickly. Some hashing algorithms, such as Bcrypt, are designed so that hashing on a GPU does not provide any speed improvement over using a CPU; this helps them resist cracking.

## Hashcat

To use hashcat:

```shell
    hashcat -m <hash_type> -a <attack_mode> hashfile wordlist
```

# Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (or BST) is a data structure used in computer science for organizing and storing data in a sorted manner. Each node in a Binary Search Tree has at most two children, a left child and a right child, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations on the data stored in the tree.

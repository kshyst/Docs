# Super Key 

A super key is a set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a record in a table. It may contain additional attributes that are not necessary for unique identification.

# Candidate Key

A candidate key is a minimal super key, meaning it has no unnecessary attributes. It can uniquely identify a record in a table and is a potential primary key.

# Primary Key

A primary key is a candidate key that is chosen to uniquely identify records in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values. Each table can have only one primary key.

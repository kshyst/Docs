# Attack Types

## Spoofing

> In the context of information security, and especially network security, a spoofing attack is a situation in which a person or program successfully identifies as another by falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage.

## CSRF Attack

> CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that impersonates a trusted user and sends a website unwanted commands.
> This can be done, for example, by including malicious parameters in a URL behind a link that purports to go somewhere else:

```html
<img src="https://www.example.com/index.php?action=delete&id=123" />
```

> For users who have modification permissions on https://www.example.com, the \<img> element executes action on https://www.example.com without their noticing, even if the element is not at https://www.example.com.

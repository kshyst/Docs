# PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)

it's the standard method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals. It is the raw data format used for standard audio in computers, Compact Discs (CDs), digital telephony, and most uncompressed audio file formats (like .wav or .aiff).

## How It Works

Converts a continuous analog wave into 0s and 1s.

### 1.Sampling

The system takes a snapshot (sample) of the analog signal’s amplitude at uniform intervals. The frequency at which these snapshots are taken is called the Sampling Rate.

## Mingle

When a Celery worker starts up, it doesn't want to be left out of the loop. To ensure it's up-to-date with the latest information, it interacts with other existing workers. This process is called "mingling". During this interaction, the worker gathers information about tasks that have been revoked and the logical clocks of the other workers. Essentially, this is a synchronization step and it happens just onceâ€”at startup time.

### Analogy
Picture this as arriving at a meeting slightly late. Before diving into the agenda, you might quickly ask a colleague for any critical updates you missed in the initial minutes.

Mingle is by default enabled in celery

### `--without--mingle`

Celery workers started up with the `--without-mingle option`, will not receive synchronization data from other workers, particularly revoked tasks. So if you revoke a task, all workers currently running will receive that broadcast and store it in memory so that when one of them eventually picks up the task from the queue, it will not execute it:

[Persistent Revokes](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/workers.html#persistent-revokes)

But if a new worker starts up before that task has been dequeued by a worker that received the broadcast, it doesn't know to revoke the task. If it eventually picks up the task, then the task is executed. You will see this behavior if you're running in an environment where you are dynamically scaling in and out celery workers constantly.

## Gossip

As workers perform their duties, they maintain a light chatter with one another. This is termed as "Gossip". Right now, the main reason workers maintain this light chatter is to synchronize their "clocks" or their sense of time. This is also a synchronization step that happens continuously.


### Analogy
This can be likened to a busy office environment, where colleagues might provide quick updates about their work progress or any new developments. Celery workers keep each other informed to ensure a harmonious and informed working environment.

By default it is enabled

## Hearbeats

Heartbeats are signals sent at regular intervals to verify the connectivity and liveliness of a worker. They're analogous to a pulse or heartbeat in living organisms, signifying that a system is active and functioning. Within Celery, they ensure that a worker is still connected to the broker and is operating as expected. If a Heartbeat fails, it's an indication that there might be an issue with the worker, and corrective actions can be taken.

It is by default enabled

### `--without-heartbeat`
